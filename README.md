# Energy Bill Analyzer

An Application that scans the user’s energy data to reduce energy spending by providing personalized insights 

## Energy Bill Analyzer: What is it? 

Energy Saver Analyzer is an innovative application designed to help users reduce their energy costs. It utilizes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to extract text from uploaded bills, specifically PG&E bills, and employs an advanced AI model to analyze the data. The app provides personalized advice on how to lower energy expenses. One of its key features is a file search tool that enables the chatbot to temporarily extract and store information from a PDF without requiring a database. Additionally, the chatbot can recognize text from images through OCR, making the analysis process seamless and efficient.

## Why Energy Bill Analyzer

The Energy Bill Analyzer simplifies the complexity of energy bills by providing clear insights and personalized recommendations to help users reduce their energy consumption and costs. It enables users to track and monitor their energy usage, set budget goals, and make informed decisions for more efficient and sustainable energy practices. By offering a convenient way to understand and manage energy consumption, the app helps users save money and reduce their environmental footprint.

Our Application lets users:
  - Identify Savings Opportunities by breaking down the information into easy-to-understand insights
  - Track and Monitor Usage offers a way to monitor consumption trends and compare different billing periods
  - Informed Decision Making make more informed decisions about their energy usage, such as when to use certain appliances or how to adjust their habits to save energy.

## Our Solution 

Creating a web-app that will scan the user’s energy data and provide personalized insights

Our Prototype aims to:

1. Analyzing Information
   - The chatbot can now temporarily store user input while also proficiently extracting and analyzing information from an uploaded PDF.

2. Temporary PDF Information Extractor
   - This feature was created by implementing OpenAI's File Search feature and an OCR tool called Pytesseract. They can submit a PDF file up to 200MB per submission.

3. Image Text Recognizer
   - This lets the chatbot know precisely what to look for in a user's uploaded document when utilizing OCR. The chatbot then provides an output summarizing the bill and giving feedback based on its analysis. Once the analysis is complete, the user is prompted to ask a follow-up question if the user wants clarification or more information.

Our Goal: 

"Energy Bill Analyzer" is to provide users with a detailed and accurate analysis of their energy consumption and billing. It aims to help users understand their energy usage patterns, identify potential areas for cost savings, and optimize their energy consumption for increased efficiency and reduced expenses. By leveraging advanced features such as generative AI, chatbots, NLP, and computer vision, the Energy Bill Analyzer seeks to deliver personalized insights and recommendations to users, making it easier for them to manage and reduce their energy costs effectively.
